We bring that idea into our beers. <br />If you want an average beer you know where you can find it. <br /><em>If you want something unique, find a <span class="theclub">Red Club</span>.</em></p>

			<!--Requirement 1

			- Added a new page for Brewing Tools
				-added a Specfic Gravity Calculator. Takes the current gallons of wort, and the current gravity and calculates the final gravity when given a final boil size in gallons. A very handy calculator for brewers
					so that they know what their gravity will be after the boil is done, so they can calculate how much, if any, water or extra malt to add to reach their desired final gravity. The volume in gallons curently
					is more than the Post boil gallons. For example, the gallons currently could be 7.5, the iniial specific gravity of the wort could be 1.054, and the desired post boil volume could be 5.5
				-added an Alcohol by Volume calculator. Input the starting and final gravities and it will display the ABV. This is a common question on the homebrewing forums. It seems that many people do not know how to
					to calculate this on their own, and often rely on other forum members to do it for them. The form the gravities should be input as, 1.053 for example. The final gravity is lower than the initial gravity
					such as 1.002.
				-added a search bar that can search either Google.com or BJCP.com. The search is to find out more information on a style of beer that you are interseted in.
				-fixed all the external links so that they open into a new page instead of in the same window as the current page. This allows the user to stay on their current page, so they do not have to rely on
					the back button to get back to the page they were on before they clicked a link.
				-added CSS transform property to the images on the beers.html page. Made the beer images 5% larger on hover to make it more evident that the images are clickable links.
				-added CSS to make the cursor stay an arrow throughout the entire document instead of changing to an I-bar when it goes over text.



				Requirement 2
					Implemented JavaScript in multiple places on the Brewing Tools (tools.hmtl) page. addEventListener's and Functions were used to make it functional. The descriptions of what the individual Javascript items
					are in Req 1.
